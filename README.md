# Travel_Insurance_habits

I made this as part of the Data Camp Analyst Certification

To recreate the data for Tableau run the Tableau Prep builder file first (it currently expects a folder called data) and then connect to the data in Tableau.

I have also created most of the same graphs in Python in the ipynb file. Mostly the graphs in the presentation are from Tableau.

The report can roughtly be distilled down to this graph and to say that the prices are too high.

Here is another graph where I built a logistic regression model just for this graph.
